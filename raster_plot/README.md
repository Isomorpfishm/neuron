In this raster plot `test.png`, I visualised the spikes recorded from the first circuit under the first simulation pattern. The data array has a dimension of 10 * 25 * 4, which represents 10 repetitions, 25 time units, and 4 electrode at different corners of the circuit (top left (Tl), top right (Tr), bottom right (Br), and bottom left (Bl)). To plot the diagram more easily, I transposed the data array into 4 * 25 * 10. I used four colours (blue (B), red (R), green (G), and black (K)) and different linestyles to represents the four corners of the circuit, respectively. On the x-axis are the time units the repetitions are placed on the y-axis.
